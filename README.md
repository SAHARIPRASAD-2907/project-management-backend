# Project management with Graph-QL

- GraphQL us an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data.
- It is an an alternative to REST API, with some added benifits such as the ability to request the exact data what you want.
- GraphQL servers have a "schema " that specifies all of the fields as well as their "types"
- The most basic components of a GraphQL schema are **Object types**.

## Getting started

- There are a lot of different technologies to choose from. There are also different methods for creating schemas, types, queries etc.
- We will be using a package called **express-graphql** which is a GrapgQL server for Node.js with tools to use with Express.
- Apollo Server is another popular tool that you can use as well as some content management system like Graph CMS to easily create a GraphQL API.
